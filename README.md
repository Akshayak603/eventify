# Eventify
This is a flask application with CRUD functionality and data visualization.
In this application we have used Python (flask) and Sqlite(local), Postgres(Prod) (via SQLAlchemy) as a backend and for frontend we have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5 and JS.

We have also build this application as MVC model (Models, Views, Controllers) for a better code and integrated matplotlib and numpy for data visulaization and comparision.
We have also include a basic modular structure of Flask which include static folder, template folder, requirements.txt and app.py (main_app).

Also, in the end we have used pytest for test cases.

## Main Features
- User Registration & Login with reset password functionality.
- Create/Read/Delete/Update
- Events: Title, Date, Time, Location, Description.
- Visualize events on matplotlib
